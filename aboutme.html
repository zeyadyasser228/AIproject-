    <h2 id="about">About me :</h2>
    <p>
      As a Full Stack .NET Developer and trainer at DEPI, I combine technical
      expertise with hands-on teaching experience to deliver high-quality
      solutions and training. My core skills span both front-end and back-end
      development, leveraging the power of the .NET framework for building
      secure, scalable, and efficient web applications. On the front end, I am
      proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, crafting intuitive and responsive
      user interfaces that ensure seamless user experiences. With my practical
      experience, I have successfully designed and implemented various projects,
      such as car sales systems with integrated databases, API management, and
      user authentication functionalities. I ensure that my solutions are both
      robust and future-proof by staying current with the latest development
      trends and technologies. In addition to my development expertise, I serve
      as a trainer at DEPI, where I help aspiring developers enhance their
      skills in software development. My ability to communicate complex
      technical concepts in a clear and approachable manner has allowed me to
      make a significant impact in this role. Currently, I am pursuing my
      studies at the Faculty of Computer and AI, where I continuously expand my
      knowledge in artificial intelligence, data science, and software
      engineering. My academic background and industry experience provide me
      with a unique perspective, enabling me to blend theoretical knowledge with
      practical application. Beyond my technical skills, I pride myself on
      strong soft skills such as leadership, teamwork, and problem-solving,
      which have helped me excel both in collaborative projects and as an
      individual contributor.
